# Spam_Mail_Detection
ABSTRACT:
Email communication is an integral part of both personal and professional interactions.
However, the proliferation of spam emails presents a significant challenge, leading to reduced
productivity and potential security threats. This project addresses the problem by developing a
spam detection system using Logistic Regression, a machine learning algorithm well-suited for
binary classification tasks.
The first step in the strategy is to gather a labelled dataset of emails that includes both spam
and real (ham) emails. Text cleaning, tokenisation, and feature extraction are some of the
preparation steps the data goes through to transform the unstructured email content into a
format that can be analysed. The performance of the model is then assessed by dividing the
dataset into subsets for training and testing.
The processed data is used to train a logistic regression model, which identifies the traits and
patterns that set spam emails apart from real ones. The trained model is then used to
categorise fresh, unseen emails as either spam or ham after attaining suitable results.
